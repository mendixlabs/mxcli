// ALTER STYLING was the one statement whose entire job is writing design
// properties, and the one statement MDL-WIDGET11 never looked at.
//
// ValidateDesignPropertiesForStatement switches on CreatePageStmtV3,
// CreateSnippetStmtV3 and AlterPageStmt (its INSERT / REPLACE trees).
// *ast.AlterStylingStmt is not among them, so an unsupported key was silent
// until mxbuild:
//
//	alter styling on page … widget lvThings set ( 'Remove empty text': on );
//	  mxcli check --references -> Check passed!
//	  mxcli exec               -> Updated styling on widget "lvThings"
//	  mxcli docker check       -> [CE6083] "Design property Remove empty text is
//	                              not supported by your theme."  1 error
//
// Measured on a blank 11.12.2 project; the same statement with 'Row size' =
// 'Small' is 0 errors (ako/mxcli#509).
//
// # Two passes: any type without the document, the widget's own type with it
//
// The other three statements CARRY the widget, so the validator reads its type
// off the AST and checks the key against that type's properties.
// AlterStylingStmt carries only a widget NAME (mdl/ast/ast_styling.go) — it
// names a widget already stored, whose $Type lives only in the document.
//
// This pass (validateAlterStylingDesignProps) runs with no project at all —
// `mxcli check script.mdl`, the corpus default — so it asks the question that
// IS answerable without the document: does ANY widget type in the theme declare
// this key? A key no type declares cannot be right for this widget either
// (#509's reported case).
//
// The reference pass then opens the document (validateAlterStylingStoredTypes,
// the pageProbe capability, opened as validateAlterSetProperties opens it) and
// judges every key the first pass let through against the widget's OWN type:
// the stored $Type → theme group mapping is the one ALTER PAGE SET's routing
// already uses (designPropsKeyOfStored), and the group's keys come from
// GetPropertiesForWidget, so the `Widget` group's inherited keys are included
// rather than re-derived. No third resolver (ako/mxcli#613). That is what
// catches a key declared for some OTHER type — `Row size`, a ListView key, on a
// DynamicText is CE6083, and the any-type question passed it.
//
// It has to be the reference pass, not a project opened from this one: the
// validators' own read-only connection (openProjectForValidation) refuses
// OpenPageForMutation — "not connected for writing" — which a mock backend
// does not, so only a run against a real project shows it. Splitting by key
// (the second pass reports only keys the first accepted) is what keeps one key
// from being reported twice.
//
// Where the stored type cannot be established — the widget is not stored, its
// type has no theme group, or the script itself creates or grows the document
// — the second pass is silent and the first pass's answer stands.
// Under-reporting, never over-reporting, is the only safe direction for a check
// that cannot see what it is judging.
//
// mdlKeywordToDesignPropsKey and bsonTypeToDesignPropsKey remain two tables;
// this consumes the second and unifies neither (out of scope for #613).

// validateAlterStylingDesignProps reports (MDL-WIDGET11) an ALTER STYLING design
// property key that no widget type in the project's theme declares.
//
// A warning, never an error, matching the authoring paths: a newer theme may add
// keys the snapshot lacks, and blocking a script that would have worked is worse
// than the gap it replaces.
//
// reg is nil, or empty, when the project has no themesource defining design
// properties. There is then nothing to be undeclared relative to, and the honest
// answer is silence — otherwise every key in every script becomes a warning.
