// Resolving the `Image:` reference an image widget now carries.
//
// Wiring the `image` operation gave MDL a new qualified name to get wrong, and
// the first thing a typo did was slip past the reference check and fail the
// build instead:
//
//	image imgTypo (Image: 'MyFirstModule.Images.NoSuchImage')
//
//	mxcli check --references -> Check passed!
//	mx check                 -> [CE1613] "The selected image
//	                            'MyFirstModule.Images.NoSuchImage' no longer exists."
//
// Every other name a widget can carry — microflow, nanoflow, page, snippet,
// entity — is resolved by validateWidgetReferences. This is the same check for
// the one reference that has THREE parts: Module.Collection.Image. Which half is
// wrong decides where the author has to look, so the two mistakes get two
// messages.

// imageRefErrors reports the image references in refs that do not resolve.
//
// known holds every image as a three-part qualified name and collections every
// image collection as a two-part one, both spelled as stored: Mendix resolves
// an image reference case-sensitively in every part (measured on 11.13.0 — a
// case difference anywhere is CE1613), so the match is exact, and a miss that
// differs only in case names the stored spelling. A nil map means the
// project's collections could not be listed — then nothing is reported,
// because calling every image missing on a failed read is the wrong direction
// to be wrong in. An empty non-nil map is a real answer: the project has no
// image collections, so any reference to one is wrong.
