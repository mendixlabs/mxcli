var checkCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "check <file|-> [file...]",
	Short: "Check an MDL script for errors without executing it",
	Long: `Check an MDL script file for syntax errors and optionally validate references.

Without a project it checks syntax and the semantic rules that need no model.
With a project it also resolves every reference — modules, entities, pages,
microflows and icons — against that project; --references is implied by a
project and is kept only for compatibility.

The project is the one passed with -p or, without -p, the single .mpr in the
current directory, auto-detected as for every mxcli command (the "Using
project:" line says which). Run from a project directory, a plain
"mxcli check script.mdl" therefore checks references too. Pass --no-project to
check syntax and the no-model rules only, wherever it is run.

It also resolves MEMBER names, not just the entity they belong to: an attribute
named in a create/change activity is looked up on that entity and its
generalizations, so a typo is reported here rather than as CE1613 at the far end
of a build. This needs the target's entity to be known, which it is for a create
(the entity is in the statement) and for a change on a parameter, a database
retrieve, an association retrieve, or a loop over one of those. A variable bound
by some other activity is left unchecked rather than guessed at.

The same applies inside widgets: a page's XPath constraint has every step
resolved against the entity it filters, and a template parameter (ContentParams
/ CaptionParams) rooted in a variable is reported with no project at all.

Expression kinds are checked where the position declares one: a bare word as a
create/change member's value (Mendix expressions have no bare identifiers), and
a log message's template parameter, which must be a String — Mendix does not
coerce there, so wrap a non-String one in toString(...).

Reference validation is smart: it automatically skips references to objects
that are created within the script itself. For example, if your script creates
a module "MyModule" and then creates entities in it, no error will be reported
for the module reference.

Creation ORDER is checked separately, and without a project. The executor
resolves most references when it writes the referring document, so naming
something a later statement creates fails partway through "mxcli exec" — with
earlier statements already written, since exec is not transactional. Those are
reported as MDL-ORDER01 (and MDL-PAGE01 for a widget's page reference).

Given a project it also type-checks the expressions in the script's microflows
and nanoflows: comparing an enumeration attribute to a string literal (in a
create/change member, or in a condition such as: if $obj/Status = 'Open'),
operand and argument type mismatches, and the like. Attribute paths resolve
through associations too, so $Order/Sales.Order_Customer/Name is typed.
These need the project to answer what an attribute's type is and which values an
enumeration has, which is why they need -p. They report under exprcheck's own
E0xx codes, and — like every other check here — only an error severity fails the
run.

Given a project it also predicts what exec would refuse. A "create or modify"
of a microflow or nanoflow the project holds is applied as a patch of the stored
flow; a change the patch cannot make (inside a loop body, a redrawn connector, a
return in an inserted fragment, ...) is refused by exec under "mdl 1;", and
check reports it as an MDL-V1-REBUILD error with exec's message. Under mdl 0
exec rebuilds the whole flow instead, and check reports the MDL-V1-REBUILD
warning exec prints. An "alter microflow|nanoflow" exec would refuse is MDL090.

Given a project it also applies exec's version gates: a statement the project's
Mendix version cannot store (create view entity below 10.18, send email below
11.13, ...) is MDL-VERSION01, with the message exec refuses it with. See
"show features" for the floors.
This is the verdict "mxcli diff" reports as "Refused:", computed by the same
code. A statement on a flow an earlier statement of the script changes, or
whose flow does not build until an earlier statement has run, is not predicted.

Several files are checked as one script set, run in the order given, as
"mxcli exec" would run them one after the other. With a project, each file is
resolved against a scratch copy of it that the files before it have been
applied to, so a name an earlier file creates resolves in a later one; a file
that does not pass is left out of the copy, as exec's pre-flight would refuse
it and write nothing. The project itself is not changed. A test file
(.test.mdl, .test.md) can be one of the files: it creates nothing itself, so
when its tests call a microflow a setup script creates, check the two together,
the setup script first — checked alone, the test file reports the microflow as
not found. The set is also first
read as a whole for two "create or modify" statements declaring the same flow — a placeholder
("stub") followed by the real flow. That is reported as an MDL-STUB01 warning
naming both statements: run in order, the stub replaces the real flow before
the real statement restores it, on every run, and with the two under different
language headers the real statement can be refused while the stub's rebuild
goes through. Since #843 a self-recursive flow is created in one statement, so
the stub can be dropped. One file alone is not read this way.

Output includes structured rule IDs (MDL prefix for reference and script rules,
E0xx for expression type rules) for each validation issue.

A deprecated MDL spelling — an alias left over from consolidating MDL onto one
canonical form, such as "create or replace" for "create or modify" or "show" for
"list" — is reported as an MDL-DEPRnnn warning naming the canonical form. Pass
--deprecations=error to fail the run on one instead, e.g. in CI over docs.

A headerless script is mdl 0, and every construct in it that means something
else, or is refused, under "mdl 1;" is reported as an MDL-V1-* warning
(MDL-V1-SLASH, MDL-V1-SEMI, MDL-V1-LIMIT1, MDL-V1-QUOTEDEXPR, the MDL-V1-REBUILD
warning form, ...). Pass --v1=error to fail the run on one. The two flags gate
different things: a script can pass --deprecations=error and still not parse
under mdl 1, so --deprecations=error --v1=error together is the full mdl 1
readiness gate. "mxcli fmt --upgrade --header" is the fix for both. A script
already headed "mdl 1;" reports no MDL-V1-* warning.

Use --post-migration to scan an existing project (independent of the script)
for legacy native widgets that have pluggable replacements — Studio Pro does
not auto-migrate these on a Mendix major-version upgrade.

Examples:
  # Check syntax only, even in a directory holding an .mpr
  mxcli check script.mdl --no-project

  # Check syntax, resolve references, and type-check expressions
  mxcli check script.mdl -p app.mpr

  # The same, against the .mpr auto-detected in the current directory
  mxcli check script.mdl

  # Scan the project for legacy native widgets after a Mendix upgrade
  mxcli check script.mdl -p app.mpr --post-migration

  # Output as JSON or SARIF: one document on stdout covering every phase
  # (progress goes to stderr); the exit code still says whether it passed
  mxcli check script.mdl --format json
  mxcli check script.mdl -p app.mpr --format sarif > results.sarif

  # Gate a headerless script on being ready for "mdl 1;"
  mxcli check script.mdl -p app.mpr --deprecations=error --v1=error

  # Check a script set, run in this order
  mxcli check 10-domain.mdl 20-flows.mdl 30-pages.mdl -p app.mpr

  # Check a test file against what its setup script creates
  mxcli check setup.mdl tests/orders.test.mdl -p app.mpr

  # Read the script from stdin
  cat script.mdl | mxcli check -
